# Summary:
The Munchkin Marvel Combat Calculator, or M2-C2, is an Android application that will calculate a player’s combat strength against a specific villain card. Users can set up their current profile, specifying which cards they have ready for combat. The program will initially calculate their base combat strength from each card. User will select the villain they’re facing, along with the battle environment (if applicable.) M2-C2 will take into account of the special effect of each card in combat before displaying the player’s final combat value.
